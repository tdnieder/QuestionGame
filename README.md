# QuestionsGame

The QuestionGame is a simple Q&A game where questions are printed out on the screen and three possible answers are presented. The get to the next question the correct answer has to be clicked on.

The QuestionGame is intendet to be used with touchscreen. No Cursor is displayed.

The game has an old school vibe of the very early 80's game where sometimes text was printed out character by character. The black background and green consolas font complete the look and feel. The frustrating part is, that the game will restart after a single wrong answer. Then the whole welcoming text must be endured again to start answering questions.

Originally the game was created as a wedding game for a friend. The game was run on a raspberry pi 3 and a power bank. The game was first played bridal couple and later in the evening handed around and played by the guests. It's intention was to give the guests an idea of the work place and the work our friend is doing everyday.
